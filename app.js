/*
// Initial logic layout for game

// Query select into a var all tile div's
// Query select into a var listeners to span's and p's of the bottom menu that will display messages
// Set variables like score and player turn


// Figure out a way to run conditional tests for winner.. needs to be a function to checkWinner()
    // after each player has selected a tile change the color scheme of that tile
    // &&
    // e.g. if 3 successive tiles then show winner message and some glow effect on those tiles?

    // TEST: If 3 tiles in a row, column or diagonal add to 15 -> we have a winner?

// Figure out some scoring system that allows us to tally and determine a winner for selections


// What event handlers do I need to setip to get this things working!
